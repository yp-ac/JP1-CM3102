Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods on Mount Olympus. 
His name is cognate with the first syllable of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. 
Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach.
